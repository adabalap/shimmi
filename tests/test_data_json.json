      "Spock let me tell you about my educational background. I graduated from the University of Washington in 2018 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. During my time there, I was particularly interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning courses. I did an internship at Microsoft during my junior year, which was an incredible experience. I worked on the Azure team, specifically on cloud infrastructure optimization. After graduation, I joined a startup called TechVenture as a junior developer. I spent two years there learning full-stack development, working with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. The startup culture was intense but rewarding - we were a team of just 12 people trying to build a SaaS platform for project management. Unfortunately, the startup didn't secure Series B funding and had to shut down in 2020. That's when I joined my current company, DataFlow Solutions, where I've been for the past four years working my way up to senior engineer.",
      "Spock I should also mention some personal goals and aspirations I have. In the next year, I want to complete a marathon - I've been training for the Seattle Marathon happening in November. I'm currently running about 30 miles per week and following a structured training plan. I also want to learn Spanish, as I'm planning a trip to Spain and Portugal next summer with my best friend Emma, who I've known since college. We're planning to spend three weeks backpacking through Barcelona, Madrid, Lisbon, and Porto. I'm really excited about trying authentic paella and port wine. Career-wise, I'm aiming to transition into a machine learning engineering role within the next two years. I've been taking online courses on Coursera and deeplearning.ai to build up my skills. I'm particularly interested in natural language processing and computer vision applications. My dream would be to work on something that has real social impact, maybe in healthcare or education technology."
